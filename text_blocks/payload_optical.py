SPACE_PAYLOADS_PROCESS = """Process Defining Space Payloads
Use mission objectives, con, reqs, const to select payload objectives
Conduct subject trades
Develop payload ConOps
Determine required payload capabilities to meet objectives
Identify candidate payloads
Estimate candidate payload capabilities and characteristics
Evaluate candidate payloads and select baseline
Assess lifecycle costs and operability of payload and mission
Identify and negotiate payload-derived requirements
Document and iterate
"""

TYPES_OF_PAYLOADS = """Types of Payloads
Remote sensing: passive and active
Passive uses reflected/emitted radiation for imaging, spectroscopy
Active uses sources like lasers for altimetry, radar sounders, or probing

Imaging Systems: Framing cameras, push-broom designs, and push-frame
"""

SENSOR_DESIGNS = """Sensor Designs
Design solutions vary based on wavelength:
Infrared uses elements like InGaAs or Germanium
Visible light involves reflected sunlight for mineralogical analysis
UV/EUV targets plasma and atmospheric interactions
TIR and microwave examine thermal emissions, gas velocities, subsurface
"""

CAMERA_EXAMPLES = """Camera Examples
OSIRIS: On Rosetta, 3-axis stabilized system for comet surface monitoring
CaSSIS: Push-frame imager with CMOS tech for Mars
HiRISE: High-res push-broom imager on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
"""

ENGINEERING_CHALLENGES = """Engineering Challenges
Mirrors need lightweight and high-reflective coatings
CCD and CMOS detectors need cooling for dark current control and radiation
Filter systems prevent reflections and high-energy particle interference
"""

MISSION_CONSIDERATIONS = """Mission Considerations
Design depends on:
Science goals for resolution and instrument capabilities
Mission profile for environment and spatial needs
Cost and spacecraft configuration for optimal payload architecture
"""

EXAMPLES_AND_PROBLEMS = """Examples and Problems
OSIRIS required dust protection and narrow/wide-angle capabilities
IR detectors need active cooling; 
optical systems face stray light and thermal equilibrium issues
High-res imagers require alignment and materials matching thermal props
