Achieving stable orbit depends on launch angles, atmospheric 
conditions, and target planet characteristics
Inclination and Launch Latitude
Minimum inclination equals launchpad latitude. Prograde launches 
use Earths rotation velocity for efficiency
Multistage Rockets
Staging propulsion optimizes payload-to-orbit ratios
Rendezvous and Docking in LEO
Hohmann transfers and phasing maneuvers enable spacecraft docking
Interplanetary Travel
Patched conics simplify trajectories, using sphere of influence (SOI) 
of celestial bodies
Atmospheric Re-entry
Skip entry reduces thermal loads. Thermal protection systems (TPS) 
manage re-entry heat
