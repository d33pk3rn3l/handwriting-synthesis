PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_TOPICS = """Magic Triangle
Defines project constraints: time, cost, quality. 
All affect project scope and delivery balance
Management Methods: Agile vs Classic
Agile is iterative, flexible, team-driven. 
Classic is linear, structured, milestone-driven
Major Milestones
Key points in project lifecycle. Examples: start, 
midway reviews, deliverables, project close
Project Organization
Defines roles, responsibilities, workflows. 
Can follow matrix, hierarchical, or flat structures
Types of Costs
Direct (materials, labor), indirect (utilities, admin), 
fixed (rent), variable (per unit), sunk (irrecoverable)
Impacts of Cost Estimation
Influences budgeting, risk management, decision-making. 
Underestimation risks delays, overestimation impacts ROI
How to Estimate Costs?
Use techniques like analogous, parametric, 
bottom-up estimation. Factor time, materials, risk
Deming Cycle
PDCA: Plan, Do, Check, Act. Iterative method for 
continuous improvement in processes
Milestone Trend Analysis
Tracks changes in milestones over time. 
Helps visualize delays, progress trends
Risk Probability Matrix
Plots risks by likelihood and impact. 
High risk: high probability, high impact. Used for prioritizing

PROJECT_MANAGEMENT_OVERVIEW = """Overview
Links project aspects: planning, cost, schedule, control, 
procurement, risk, quality, and communication
Facts to Memorize
Magic Triangle: scope, time, cost. 
Agile vs. Classic methods. Key milestones and organization
Cost types, estimation impacts, Deming Cycle, Milestone 
Trend Analysis, Risk Probability Matrix
Introduction
Purpose of PM: master complexity, transparency, risks. 
Magic Triangle extended with quality and risks
Process
1. Initialization: scope, PM approach
2. Definition: goals, requirements, team
3. Planning: tasks, schedules, costs
4. Execution: monitoring, adjustments
5. Closing: formal end, feedback for improvement
Methods
Plan-Based: structured, sequential, ex: Waterfall
Agile: iterative, fast, roles: Product Owner, Scrum Master
Hybrid: mixes structured & adaptive techniques
Project Planning
Mission: core purpose. Vision: long-term outcome. 
SMART goals, milestones: MDR, SRR, CDR, QR, etc
Organization
Defines roles, responsibilities (e.g., Contact Officer, System 
Engineer). Uses Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) for tasks
Cost & Schedule Management
Cost Categories: labor, materials, infrastructure. 
Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up estimates. Use Gantt charts for scheduling
Control
Deming Cycle: Plan, Do, Check, Act. Monitor deviations in 
cost and schedule with Earned Value Analysis
Procurement
Plan-based vs. Agile. Use RFIs, RFQs, RFPs. Methods 
vary by scope, tender process: restricted or open
Risk Management
Identify, analyze, manage, monitor. Risk is probability x impact. 
Methods: risk trend charts, assessment matrices
Quality Management
Quality assurance ensures methods are consistent. Tools: 
fishbone diagrams, control charts, Pareto, histograms
Communication
Effective stakeholder engagement. Use formal (reports) and 
informal (mails). Kick-offs establish goals, roles
Closeout
Final report on objectives, results, lessons learned. 
Key elements: adherence to costs, quality, stakeholder satisfaction
"""

ANALYSIS_TECHNIQUES = """Earned Value (EV) Analysis
Tracks project performance by comparing planned, earned, 
and actual values. Key metrics: SPI (Schedule Performance Index), 
CPI (Cost Performance Index), and variance analysis
PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique)
Estimates project duration using optimistic, pessimistic, 
and most likely time estimates. Formula: 
Expected Time 
Critical Path Method (CPM)
Identifies the longest sequence of dependent tasks. 
Determines project duration and flexibility (float/slack)
Gantt Chart
Visualizes schedule with timelines for tasks. 
Shows critical path, dependencies, and resource allocation
Monte Carlo Simulation
Probabilistic method to assess risks and project uncertainty. 
Uses iterations to simulate possible outcomes
SWOT Analysis
Analyzes Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats. 
Strategic tool for decision-making and risk assessment
Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa)
Identifies root causes of problems. Categories: 
People, Machines, Materials, Methods, Environment
Milestone Trend Analysis (MTA)
Tracks changes in milestone dates over time. Visualizes 
delays or progress using trendlines
Risk Probability Matrix
Plots risks by likelihood and impact. Prioritizes risks 
for mitigation strategies
Pareto Analysis
Focuses on the "vital few" causes generating the majority 
of effects. Basis: 80/20 principle
Histogram
Shows data distribution over time or categories. Useful 
for analyzing performance or resource patterns
