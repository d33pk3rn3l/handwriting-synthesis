VALIDATION_VERIFICATION = """Validation vs Verification
Validation ensures the system meets mission needs (the right thing?)
Verification confirms the system is built as designed (the thing right?)
"""

VERIFICATION_METHODS = """Verification Methods
1. Inspection: Uses visual evidence like pictures
2. Analysis: Employs models and simulations
3. Testing: Exercises the system and measures performance
4. Similarity: Compares features to validated items
"""

TEST_CATEGORIES = """Test Categories
Structural Tests:
Verify structural members under operational loads
Example: Static load test, modal survey
Deployment Tests:
Validate deployment and stowage of launch devices
Example: First motion, full extension, restowage
Separation Tests:
Ensure separation of components during release
Example: Release testing, separation rate measurement
Antenna Testing:
Measure electromagnetic fields and pointing control
Example: Pattern tests, closed-loop tracking
Attitude Control Testing:
Verify control responses and transition behaviors
Example: Closed-loop testing
"""

QUALIFICATION_TYPES = """Qualification Types
Dedicated Qualification Hardware:
Constructs dedicated hardware for qualification tests
Performed at relevant component qualification levels
Not intended for flight; used for cost and risk reduction
Qualify the First Set of Flight Hardware:
First flight components tested at protoqualification levels
Assembled into spacecraft for protoflight testing
Used directly in the mission after qualification
Qualify by Similarity:
Demonstrates similarity to previously qualified hardware
Uses type testing, process control, and sampling
Conducts testing at acceptance levels for validation
