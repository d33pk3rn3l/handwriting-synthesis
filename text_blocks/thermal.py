Passive
MLI: Layers of low-emittance film with thermal spacers
Conductive Isolators: Thermal stand-offs made of non-metallic material
Thermal Fillers: Conductive materials between surfaces
Surface Coatings: for specific absorptivity and emissivity
Radiators: External panels to radiate energy (optical solar reflectors)

Active
Heaters: Electrical resistance elements for generating heat
Heat Pipes: transfer heat via a two-phase process using capillary action
