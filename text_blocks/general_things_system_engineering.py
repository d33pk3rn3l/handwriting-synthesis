IMPORTANT_MILESTONES = """Important Milestones
PDR: evaluates preliminary design to ensure it meets requirements
CDR: assesses mission components if ready for fabrication and integration

REQURIREMENTS = """Requirements
Requirements before analysis, requirements before design!
Requirements must be changed to always be up to date!

System requirements fall in three main areas
- Functional (E.g., what should it do?)
- Operational (E.g., how do I run it, get the data down?)
- Constraints (E.g., how much can it cost?)

Requirement Evolution
- Phase A: Define the mission requirements
- Phase B: Identify critical driving requirements and risks
- Phase C: Specify system and segment definition and add interface
- Phase D: Flow down, formal design documentation

MISSION_ANALYSIS_AND_UTILITY = """Mission Analysis and Mission Utility
Feasibility Assessment: Determines if the problem is achievable
Sizing Estimates: fundamental parameters (size, weight, power, cost)
Point Design: baseline system design wo optimization to demo feasibility
Utility Analysis: quantitative alignment with mission objectives using 
performance parameters and measures of effectiveness
Trade Studies: Impact of key parameters on cost, risk, and performance
Performance Assessment: Using system algorithms, analogies, or simulations
