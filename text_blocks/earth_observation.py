ATMOSPHERIC_EFFECTS = """Atmospheric Effects
EM radiation interacts with atmospheric molecules, aerosols, dust through:
Rayleigh Scattering: Particles smaller than wavelengths (blue sky effect)
Mie Scattering: Particles similar in size to wavelengths (haze, fog)
Non-Selective Scattering: Larger particles scatter all wavelengths (clouds)
Atmospheric Windows are wavelength ranges with minimal interference

ACTIVE_VS_PASSIVE_SENSING = """Active vs. Passive Remote Sensing
Passive: Uses natural EM sources like sunlight
Active: Uses artificial EM sources (ex:radar) for independent measurements
"""

RESOLUTIONS_IN_EO_IMAGING = """Resolutions in EO Imaging
Spatial: Clarity based on pixel density, 1m per pixel
Radiometric: Sensitivity to intensity variations, 8-bit grayscale
Spectral: Ability to distinguish wavelength band, 0.1-0.5 microns
Temporal: Time intervals between images, daily, hourly
"""

ESA Copernicus Program: Sentinel satellites for environment and security
Landsat Program: 15m-100m resolution with a 16-day repeat cycle
Landsat Next aims for 10m resolution and 26 spectral bands
Meteosat: Geostationary satellites for meteorology since 1977, using MVRI
Nimbus: Sun-synchronous passive microwave radiometer from the 1960s
ICESat-2: Advanced laser altimetry for surface elevation and ice dynamics
Radar Altimetry: Measures surface heights along satellite tracks
Gravity Field Measurements: GRACE uses twin satellites to map gravity 
Imaging Radar: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for high-resolution imaging
